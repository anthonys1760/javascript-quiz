# Javascript Quiz 

This is a Javascript Quiz that asks a series of questions using a prompt and evaluates each answer that the user gives. The program will store each answer the user gives in a 2d array and then use a loop to iterate through each question until the end. There are 3 questions. A conditional statement must then be used to determine if the answer the user gives is the correct or incorrect answer and then print the result to the screen.
