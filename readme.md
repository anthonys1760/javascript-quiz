# Javascript Quiz 

This is a Javascript Quiz that asks a series of questions and evaluates each answer that you give. The program will will use a loop to keep track of the number of questions answered correctly and/or incorrectly. a 2D Array was used to hold the questions and answers. Each array has one question and answer inside of it. A conditional statement must then be used to determine if the answer the user gives is the correct or incorrect answer and then print it to the screen. 

At the end of the quiz your correct or incorrect answers are printed to the screen once the loop is finished.
